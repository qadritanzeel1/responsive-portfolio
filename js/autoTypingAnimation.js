      Hi, I’m <strong>Tanzeel</strong>, a passionate Front-End Developer focused on
      building responsive, interactive, and user-friendly web applications. I enjoy
      creating clean layouts and smooth animations that enhance the overall user
      experience.
      <br><br>
      I work mainly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy crafting reusable
      components, optimizing performance, and maintaining clean code structure.
      I believe a good frontend is not just about design, but also about usability
      and accessibility.
      <br><br>
      I constantly work on improving my skills by building projects, experimenting
      with animations, and refining UI details. I’m motivated by learning new things
      and pushing myself to become a better developer with every project I build.
